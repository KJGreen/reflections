When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When collaborating with others and across multiple computers while maintaining
    matching copies of files.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    This is so that if multiple people are working on the same repository that
    you don't have to worry about overwriting each others work when you are not
    ready to upload or to mitigate conflicts

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

  Forks are copies of a repository that exist as remotes. They link back to the
  original repository that they inherit from natively. Clones are a naive copy 
  of a repository. Branches are a splitting of a repository and exist in tandem
  inside of a single repository.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?
