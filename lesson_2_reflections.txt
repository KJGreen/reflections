What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	It creates the backend files but does not comit anything. This sets up
	the files necessary for git to do version control.
	
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

	the staging area is a temporary stage. It allows you to select only certain
	files to commit so that the log is more structured

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?
	You can easily review all the changes you will commit and add or remove
	them before you finally commit the changes.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history
organized? How would branches help?
	When I implement a major structural change in the ramwalk controller like 
	a zero order hold

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
	They help you keep track of the heads and what places are reachable so you
	don't accidentally lose all your work
	
What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in
the diagram the way we do?
    We combine the changes made to files along multiple work progressions in 
	an intelegent way.

What are the pros and cons of Gitâ€™s automatic merging vs. always doing merges
manually?
    The auto merging is conservative in that it tries hard to not assume much
	about what is "correct" and instead if very predictable. It will force the
	user to fix more complex problems themselves.
